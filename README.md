# Welcome to The Platform

The Platform Elements is a minimalist set of themable elements for web designers and web developers.
There are three types of elements:

* `nn-` elements work _exactly_ like native elements (input, select, etc.)
* `en-` elements work like `nn` elements, but with enhancements (forms, advanced range, etc.)
* `ee-` elements are elements that do not resemble native ones (autocomplete, header, navbar, fab)

## Web designers

* Use the `nn-` elements by simply replacing the corresponding native ones.
* Use enhanced elements to load data from a remote server, code autocomplete, and more
* Theme elements using custom CSS properties or custom stylesheets

## Web developers

* Use [lit-element]()'s and web component's full potential
* Create custom themes or derivative elements easily
* Enjoy the fully literate source code
* Use these elements in your web application or single page application
